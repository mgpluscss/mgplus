To register specifics plugins:

To register automatically plugins on page load, use "register_plugins" query param when you import mgplus-dom.js

#### Example

```html
<script src="https://cdn.mgpluscss.com/v1.2.8/js/mgplus-dom.js?
register_plugins=dropdowns,tabs,modals,collapses,darkmode" ></script>
```

##### Register only darkmode

```html
<script src="https://cdn.mgpluscss.com/v1.2.8/js/mgplus-dom.js?
register_plugins=darkmode" ></script>
```

#### To allow plugin works for your mgplus css components

Add html attribute data-toggle=["plugin_name"] in your html components

Example:

```html
 <div class="mg-dropdown" >
      <button title="choose a car" class="mg-dropdown--icon" data-toggle="dropdown">
        Choose a car
      </button>
      <div class="mg-dropdown--content">
        <div class="mg-nav">
          <ul>
            <li data-value="audi">Audi</li>
            <li data-value="bmw">BMW</li>
            <li data-value="toyota">Toyota</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
```

#### To configure darkmode plugin

In your main html document page, add attribute data-theme=["dark" | "light" |  "auto" ]

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" data-theme="auto">

<head>
</head>
```

"auto" mode will use your system browser preference to choose dark or light mode
